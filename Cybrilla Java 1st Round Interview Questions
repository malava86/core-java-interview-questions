Given a sorted array of integers and a target integer, find the first occurrence of the target and return its index. Return -1 if the target is not in the array.

Input:

    arr = [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 10, 10, 10, 100]
    target = 3

Output: 1

Employee
 --> Managers, Software Engineers
 --> Find the employees with the same manager. 
 
 Employee 
  --> name, id, type of employee --> either as Manager or Sofware Engineers
  
  10 Rows --> out of 10, 3 rows has type is Manager, rest 7 have type is SE.
  
  Task is Software Engineers need to group, Similarly Managers need to group.
  
  A, 100, M ,  200
  B, 101, SE   100
  C, 104, M    201
  D, 105, SE   108
  E, 106, M
  F, 108, SE 
  
----------------

Each of the Managers below them how many of Software Engineers are assigned. 

Print the count of Software Engineers for Each Managers.

  Select e1.EmployeeName, count(e1.employeeName) as Total_SoftwareEngineers
  From Employee e1
  Where e1.EmployeeType = 'Software Engineers' and e1.Manager_Id = e1.employeeId


 --Select EmployeeType, MID, RANK() Over(PARTITION BY EmployeeType, PARTITION BY MID)
