You are given an array of strings words (0-indexed).

In one operation, pick two distinct indices i and j, where words[i] is a non-empty string, and move any character from words[i] to any position in words[j].

Return true if you can make every string in words equal using any number of operations, and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["abc","aabc","bc"]
Output: true
Explanation: Move the first 'a' in words[1] to the front of words[2],
to make words[1] = "abc" and words[2] = "abc"
Example 2:

Input: words = ["ab","a"]
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to make all the strings equal using the operation.

Input: words = ["aabc","abc","bc"]
