1) Let's take the following array as Input and the output should be how many number of swaps is required to move all 1's should goes to right side.

a[] = {0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1}

No.of.iteration
***************
 {0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1}
 

Solution : need to give minimum no of swaps is required.


2) Lets take the following array if we give the target as 3 means need to shift last 3 elements to first 3 indexs. Similarly First 3 elements need to swap to last 3 indexs.

Example:

a[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}

target = 3

reverseArray(a,target);

If the target is 3 means 5,6,7 need to swap to 1,2,3 indexs

  -- 5,6,7,1,2,3,4

If the target is 4 means 4,5,6,7 need to swap to 1,2,3,4 indexs

  -- 4,5,6,7,1,2,3
  
If the target is 2 means 6,7 need to swap to 1,2 indexs
    
	 6,7,1,2,3,4,5
	
if the target is 5 means 3,4,5,6,7 need to replace 1,2,3,4,5 indexs
    
	 3,4,5,6,7,1,2
	
Precondition: 
  Need to use JDK1.8 features, should not use any temporary array.
  Within the single array only need to swap the elements across the indexs.
