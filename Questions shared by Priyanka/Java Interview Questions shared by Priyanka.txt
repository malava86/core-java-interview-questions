When to use non relational DB over relational DBCoding:
1: Create a singleton class
2: input is list of students(name, age, marks) and sort them based on mark and then based on age

s1 A 30 88
s2 B 28 95
s3 C 27 85
s4 D 31 95
s5 E 26 98 

output: E, D, B, A, C3: Write a logic to break out from all the for loops without returning from current method For {
    For {
        For {
            For { }
}
}
